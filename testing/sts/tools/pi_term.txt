(*
 * The Mathematica code to evaluate the pi terms is from the paper:
 *
 * K. Hamano and T. Kaneko, The Correction of the Overlapping Template Matching Test
 * Included in NIST Randomness Test Suite, IEICE Transactions of Electronics,
 * Communications and Computer Sciences 2007, E90-A(9), pp 1788-1792.

 *      http://www.researchgate.net/publication/
 *        220241122_Correction_of_Overlapping_Template_Matching_Test_Included_in_NIST_Randomness_Test_Suite
 *
 * We used the following Mathematica code, from Appendix B of the above paper, to compute our terms.
 * We reordered the printing of the Tx[M]]/2^1032 // N vaues to print immiedately after the makeTn:=Module[..]
 * and added some newlines, whitepspace and blank lines for slightly better code clarity.
